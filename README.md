# CS341_Final_Project

In this final project, you will construct a GUI application Game World containing four types of animated
GameObject elements. Each GameObject element must be placed on the window Canvas (application
window). GameObject elements will move in distinctive ways

Type_A_GameObject: Moves up and down
Type_B_GameObject: Moves up, down, left, and right
Type_C_GameObject: Moves left and right
Type_D_GameObject: Moves under the control of the user. Can move up, down, left, and right
